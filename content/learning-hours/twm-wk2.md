## Structure of Messy Code --- Pure, Tell-Don't-Ask, and Messy

Key audience: technical.

Long methods have a common un-structure. Let’s explore it, see what that means, and how to fix it.

Requires:

* 1 laptop with code access.
* (optional) pick a long method in advance

Agenda:

1. Structure of a Messy Function
	1. Draw it.
	2. Find it in functions (the glance method)
2. Transform a Messy Function (do, if possible)
	1. CQRS
	2. The Pure Part
	3. The TDA Part

## Leadership and Ownership --- Obsoleting Accountability

Key audience: management, teams, HR.

Most companies focus on accountability. But a focus on accountability can actually significantly decrease ownership and result in decreased performance. Let’s explore how to create ownership and ensure the company gets the results they need.

You will exit this session with a different perspective on leadership, and a shift in how you do feedback that will allow you to create ownership with every interaction.

Agenda:

1. Accountability Cycle
2. Ownership Cycle
3. Questions and Feedback
	1. Toss up ideas and categorize (ownership vs accountability)
	2. Try it: presenter/leader/observers

## Decision-Making Styles ---  Rapid and Effective Decision-Making

Key audience: management, teams.

The most common default decision-making style is “nominally consensus:” we ensure every voice is heard, and listen to everyone (without clear direction)…until time runs short and someone gets frustrated. And then that person just makes a decision, because "consensus has stalled / will take to long and we just have to go.” There are other ways. Let’s explore them.

You will exit this session with a knowledge of 4 different styles, when to choose each, and the ability to get to consensus with any group up to about 60 people in around 10-15 minutes.

Agenda:

1. Present the Styles
2. Facilitating Consent

## Knowability (Cyneffin) --- The Difference Between Unknown and Unknowable

Key audience: project planners and funders. (day 1 of 2)

Some projects are best managed using backlogs. For others, using a backlog is a significant source of project failure risk. Some need MVPs and throughput accounting; for others, that is pure wasted effort. The differences arise because we need to make different kinds of decisions.

We, as humans, make decisions based on what we know. Yet often business requires making decisions where the most important input is what is not known. And there are different characteristics of “not known” that need to inform how we decide, plan, act, and govern. Let’s explore a model for understanding what key problems to focus on for what projects.

You will exit this session with an ability to identify what problems have what risk and unknown characteristics, and the key project funding and planning decisions that need to be made in each category.

Agenda:

1. Cyneffin, with examples
2. Key problem in each domain
3. Categorize Features / tasks

## Knowability Based Planning --- Planning Without Increasing the Probability of Total Project Failure

Key audience: project planners and funders. (builds on Cyneffin)

Yesterday we identified that different projects have different key problems based on their kinds of knowability. That means they need to be managed, governed, and planned with different methods. In this session, ew will define an effective project management style for each domain, including funding.

You will exit this session with multiple planning frameworks, and able to clearly communicate with each other about what to do when.

Agenda:

1. Planning in Each Domain
2. Governing Each Domain
3. Running a Project in Each Domain

##  Intentional Decision-Making

Key audience: management, teams. (builds on Decision-Making Styles)

We now have intentional styles to make decisions. However, there’s one remaining space for unclarity: who owns what decisions? Which choices should be made by the team and which by a manager? Why? How should this change over time? Let’s do a facilitated conversation to clarify decision scope.

You will exit this session with clarity around team scope and how that will change over time. You will also be able to re-run this discussion periodically as the situation changes.

Agenda:

1. Scope Exercise
2. Agree on Decision-Making Style
3. Discuss Ramifications

## Levels of Coupling

Agenda:

1.

## Read by Refactoring

Agenda:

1.

## Building Psychological Safety --- In Practice

Agenda

1. Discuss Safety Mandate
2. Do Emotion Check-in
3. Do Safety Check
4. Discuss Safety issues that come up, probably back to Safety Mandate
