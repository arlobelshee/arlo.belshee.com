# TL;DR

Me:

* I am a polymath; I go deep in many areas at once.
* I am here to improve the (often woeful) state of software engineering. I've guided both teams and organizations to #ZeroBugs and continuous, easy delivery.
* I lead using data before influence, and influence before authority.

Specialties:

* Code-oriented: language design, architecture, tool building, incrementalism, full-stack development, refactoring, code transformation, and system evolution.
* Human-oriented: include conflict navigation, team building, consultative leadership, creating a data-oriented culture, emotional fluency, and continuous transformation.
