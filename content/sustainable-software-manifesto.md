We are uncovering better ways of growing software-oriented businesses from one success to the next by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to realize our role in a better world:

* We own risk and trust others to own value.
* We own doing the work and trust others to talk about the work.
* We own creating resilience and responsiveness and trust others to sense when our environment has changed.
* We own problem definition and solution and trust others to discover problems and choose which to solve next.
* We own incrementally adding business successes without losing past success and trust others to explore hot ideas with point solutions and do pure research to find new innovations.

That is, while all of these things are equally valuable, we choose to focus our limited time, intellect, and passion on the things on the left, and trust others to focus on the things on the right.

We have also come to value some things over others:

* Bringing the past into the future over following the latest hot trend.
* Democratic data over individual opinions, even our own.
* Doing what works over wishing for what could be.
* Collaboration over individual excellence.
* Flexibility and resilience over specialization and efficiency.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, in our domain there is more value in the items on the left.

We embrace a business of equal zones. Our zone is the engine that creates all possible motion.

One peer zone brings that motion to the world. Together we deeply understand the problems our customers face and create solutions to those problems.

Another peer zone explores new ideas to discard the many that don't work and the even more that work but don't scale to meet the needs of the business. Together we scale the winning ideas into major improvements to our business engine.

Each business will have other peer zones that meet the needs of its environment. We collaborate with those zones to ensure those environmental needs connect well to our engine.
