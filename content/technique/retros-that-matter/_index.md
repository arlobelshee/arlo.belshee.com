# Retrospectives Done Well

I think of this as part of the whole improvement cycle, running a week long. And for each agenda item there is a purpose / meta-name &amp; a planned exercise. I commonly shuffle out exercises depending on the item we’re exploring (especially if we land on something the team believes is outside their control). Here goes:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <p>When</p>

### Gather Data

Emotions are powerful. Use them. They are how our minds filter important info from other info. They also tell you why a thing matters. A good starting set are: Mad, Sad, Glad, Afraid. The rest are great extensions.

If you want a change of pace, you might use Thinking Hats instead. However, I recommend using the emotions first. Emotions filter to more important insights and tend to present the situation in a more raw form, allowing better follow-on analysis.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Hat color</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
      <th>Question</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Purple</td>
      <td>Questions</td>
      <td>What am I curious about?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>White</td>
      <td>Facts</td>
      <td>What facts could help the analysis of other items?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Yellow</td>
      <td>Good</td>
      <td>What things happened that I judge as good (others might disagree with my judgment)?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Black</td>
      <td>Bad</td>
      <td>What things happened that I judge as bad (others might disagree with my judgment)?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Actions</td>
      <td>What actions could we take right now, without further disucssion?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>Emotions</td>
      <td>What emotions are in play? what do they tell us? (see above emotion list for things to put up while wearing this hat)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Identify Impact / Implementation Measures

You will need to measure two things. One is about the opportunity, one about the solution:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Measure</th>
      <th>Examines</th>
      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Impact</td>
      <td>Opportunity</td>
      <td>What would indicate that the desired result is achieved (problem solved or good thing made systemic)?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Implementation</td>
      <td>Solution</td>
      <td>What would indicate that our action constitutes a valid implementation (and thus assessment) of the proposed solution?</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Examples:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Proposal</th>
      <th>Measure</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Problem/Impact</td>
      <td>We seek to reduce stories blocked due to hand-offs between specialties.</td>
      <td>#of story-hours that stories are blocked per sprint, comparing baseline to 2 weeks after we start pairing (assume it takes 2 weeks to transfer enough skills to measure a result)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Solution/Implementation</td>
      <td>We will pair for at least 75% of all hours spent working on stories to spread skills.</td>
      <td>% of hours spent pairing each sprint</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Proposal</th>
      <th>Measure</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <span>Problem/Impact</span>
      </td>
      <td>Decrease time wasted waiting for a decision</td>
      <td>Median # of wall-clock hours between when a decision is asked for and when the decision has been communicated to all involved, looking only at decisions which are owned by the team or its first 2 levels of management.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <span>Solution/Implementation</span>
      </td>
      <td>Use decider protocol as our default decision-making model. Use explicit delegation to management when necessary.</td>
      <td>For each decision, did we start the decider within 15 minutes of needing the decision, and did that result in either a decision or an explicit delegation to management? When we delegated, did that follow our explicit delegation communication template? The experiment is valid if enough decisions are made with our new approach to give a valid comparison either to our baseline or to the population of decisions made in an unstructured way.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Solution Ideation via Consent Ideation

(Copied & modified from [Clearleft.com](https://clearleft.com/posts/344).)

#### Step 1. Divergent thinking

There is a problem or challenge which your team has to overcome. Prior to discussing it, each member of the team spends 10 minutes individually coming up with as many ideas as they can to solve the problem. Each team member then presents their ideas (without interruption) to the group. This enables team members by allowing those who may not be as loud as others a chance to show their ideas, this increases the volume of ideas surfaced and reduces the HIPPO effect.

#### Step 2. Objection your Honor

Quick-sort the presented ideas into “Will try”, “Won’t try” and “Maybe try”. The “Wills” and “Won’ts” are straight-forward, it’s the “Maybes” that are contentious and will probably have differences in opinion. This is the opportunity to object to an idea. However an objection must be valid against certain criteria.

An objection is valid if:

* The proposed idea causes harm to the business.
* There is data which supports that the idea is harmful in some way.
* The idea causes immediate danger / harm to a person.
* The proposed idea directly affects your role.

#### Step 3. Focused discussion

Discussion is obviously a part of this process however it is far more focused and action oriented. The idea is to quickly identify the ideas which will be developed and spend more time exploring and learning through the experience.

#### The goal

The goal of this concept is not to find the “right idea” at the start, as this could be debated for hours, but rather to explore a large number of ideas which allow us to get the ball rolling in the right direction and make faster progress.

### Analyze and Learn / Make Recommendations

We will not show our experiment or action at the sprint review, just like we won't show our product. The experiment will be demoed many times during the sprint and tweaked as needed (again, just like the product). The sprint review is our time to look at what we've learned from running the experiment and to apply that forward when deciding future experiments to run.

This time is our chance to analyze the data and learn. We will then crystalize that learning into specific recommendations.

A good starting point for your analysis is to categorize your story by the results of its measures:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        <p>
          <strong>Implementation</strong>
        </p>

      <th>
        <p>
          <strong>Impact</strong>

      </th>
      <th>
        <p>
