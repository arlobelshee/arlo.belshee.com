## Purpose

An active community is a key factor in successful Quality Improvement for your Strategy Area. The community provides a forum for local quality champions to meet, share ideas, and hold each other accountable for our shared quality mission. This page outlines some ideas and guidelines for getting a quality improvement community started.

## Key First Steps

* Identify a quality champion for each team.
  * One per team.
  * Can be anyone on the team.
  * They're the local driver for team's quality improvement.
  * Please record on the [Quality Improvement Champions](#company-specific-url)
* Meet regularly, say weekly.
  * Keep it focused on metrics.
  * Ensure area head or other leader is involved.
  * Structure the meeting around the teams and what they're doing. It's not a "review" but it should be a forum for teams to share what they're doing (with metrics ideally) and for seeking feedback. Your job is more of a coach than a driver in this forum.
* Use Slack for regular communication.
  * Perhaps one channel for champions and leadership and one for all interested parties.
  * Ensure questions get responses, might need to go out of your way to make this happen at first.
  * Seed the channel with interesting ideas and encourage people to participate.
* Request assistance:
  * Request **[Coaching](#url-tbd)**
  * Slack Channel - [#channel-tbd](#url-tbd)
  * Request a **[Workshop](#url-tbd)**

## Things to Keep In Mind

* Keep it simple. This is going to be a long journey and the first step is to get people interested and engaged. A good first place to get started is finding common ground and understanding about what is meant for something to be a critical bug.
* Local teams need to feel ownership of their Quality Improvement for it to be successful. We care about it at a dev-wide level but we need to foster local ownership.
* Patience is key. The Quality Improvement process is really about changing teams' habits and norms and how we think about quality. It's likely to be a slow and incremental process.
