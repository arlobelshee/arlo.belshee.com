_Customize Quality Improvement to fund and support you solving your team's most important challenges._

You've already started improving your quality by working to company-standard goals like Zero Bug Debt and Safeguarding. This process helps you customize your goals by identifying what matters most to your team and then incrementally solving it.

Use this guide to define a concrete process, start with a set of questions, and avoid common anti-patterns like unnecessary uniformity, bias towards analysis, group-think, and waiting for approval.

## The Big Picture

![](../img/customizing-components.png)

You've already developed a basic Tactical Loop and Quality Sync. Now we're going to add the Strategic Loop, which will also refine your Tactical Loop and Quality Sync.

## Step 1: Add Your Strategic Loop

(TBD - below is explanatory content describing the loop sequence. Need to make each step concrete with an example, then have sub-page that walks through the procedure. Intention / purpose of the loop goes in both places.)

Each loop, the team will:

* Improve its ability to see and understand its own quality context.
  * For example: create an data-backed value-stream map to show what delays and risks currently impact the team when and how much, or add a new source of risk or delay to the set we measure and show.
* Decide where to invest and make returns visible.
  * For example: choose to reduce the time spent investigating bugs that eventually go to another team, made visible by showing time taken per bug and percent of incoming bugs that are eventually re-assigned.
* Identify flaws in its mental models and refine.
  * For example: realize the problem wasn't that those were other teams' bugs, but that all bugs in an area require 3 of 5 particular teams to solve. Need to discover the reasons these bugs can't be solved in one team and the relative impact of each reason.

Roughly, each loop has the following structure.

1. Understand and model the problem.
2. Pick targets.
3. Define failure.
4. Identify possible solutions and pick some to try.
5. Do and measure.
6. Analyze results and update your models.

The Strategic Loop and Tactical Loop pages provide concrete ways to do this for each purpose, with examples.

### Notes to self - Suggested Process

1. Think through the problems your scrum team will face.
2. Figure out which to handle first (easiest-to-fix or most impact), and how you would measure that the problem is solved "enough" --- the level of pain will be sustainable for your target delivery cadence.
3. Present those problems to your area's quality champions, at the steering meeting. Present your plan of attack (first problem & data to track). Ask for any help you want collaborating on that problem or holding you accountable to your plan.
4. Do the work to start addressing the first problems.
5. Use the data to track your impact. Adjust plans when things don't work out; stop when you've gotten good enough, even if it doesn't feel like you are done.
6. Keep showing current status with the data at the area's champion meeting. Collaborate across teams where that is useful. Hold each other accountable where that is useful.
