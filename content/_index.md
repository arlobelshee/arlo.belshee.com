* Drives our profits and threatens our business.
* Is that one terrible codebase we strive to replace and is the only kind of code that exists.

I help people learn to see that balance. To love and respect the beauty while seeing the ugliness in greater precision. And to repair the ugliness while preserving the beauty.
