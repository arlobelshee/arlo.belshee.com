## Getting Started on Your Own

As an engineer:

Superpower: actually making things better. Only one with real data, only one with control over problem.

Weakness: tendency to self-disempower, to believe that "I am not allowed to do the right thing."

Read by Refactoring!

As a local leader:

Superpower: budgets, place people give their power to. Only one with control over fixing self-disempowerment victim mindset on the team.

Weakness: tendency to stick self in middle, trying to translate between people with different info.

Risk-aware planning. Safeguarding! And budget permission.

As an executive or mid-level manager:

Superpower: widely heard, easy to get compliance, veto power.

Weakness: most appearance of information with least actual information of all people, difficult to inspire passion / ownership, easy to inspire fear / compliance / accountability.

Inspire 5 engineers to try it! Set a big, audacious goal and message it thoroughly.
