Quick write-up of the parallel writing process for meeting conversation. Includes:

Problem statement:

Meetings, particularly ones with complex decisions, don't work well. We experience:

* Some voices aren't heard; others are over-represented.
* Easy to get stuck in details that turn out not to be relevant.
* Single-threaded conversation makes it hard to explore all directions; tend to follow a single path through the space.

Solution: structured parallel writing.

1. Timeboxed. Multiple writing sessions per meeting.
2. Silent. Yes, totally. If someone talks, especially a high-status person (usually a male manager), then **shut them down, fast**. If you know you have a problem person for this, then talk with them in advance. Tell them your intent, that you want equal voices, that theirs tends to dominate, and that they will often feel like they are being stifled. That's intentional. You are helping them learn to make space for others' ideas.
3. Write in outline view in a Google Doc or OneNote.
4. Clear starting points for the conversation (1-3 starting prompts for the top of the tree, per writing session).
5. If you don't have any statements to say, write a question under an existing statement. If you see a question you can answer, do so --- even if others also answer it in a way that disagrees.
6. Alternate: free-write, then vote & select the few ideas to carry forth.

Include a checklist for facilitators (before, during, and after the meeting).

Might need a screencast video of a session in order to really get the point across.
