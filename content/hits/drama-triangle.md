There's the game. Clear description of the roles, and of perspective-taking as the key skill.

Not sure what this can convert to: no clear sales funnel from here. But it's a cool game. Useful when taught well.

Also, I need to develop a facilitator's guide, based on what I delivered at Luminous. I don't remember what that was, but there is a recording (I think it includes my session).
