1. Accountability cycle vs ownership cycle.
2. How to help someone own their change. Mentoring, challenging, etc to support their taking ownership.
3. Metrics to use to judge how well a team is owning its destiny. Easy with safeguarding, very complete with a full set of metrics.
4. Specific set of meetings, measures, behaviors. Perhaps some job aid to help remember what to do when, for each team --- so can manage several teams and still give them everything they need each week. Good for execs (M3 and above especially).
