Give away the first part of the first room in each of the 3 houses.

* Shows the first couple disciplined refactorings.
* Assembles them to be able to address one common problem.
* Unlocks several more rooms in each house, so people can see what they'd be able to do next...if they paid. And leaves a whole bunch of rooms locked (so they can't see what's in there, only that there are a bunch more rooms).
* Is enough to get the first couple of achievements.
* Can also see a bunch more achievements, which are scattered through the house. Many don't have obvious paths to get there (many locked rooms in the way).
