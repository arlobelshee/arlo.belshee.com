Mindshift: emotions are the smart part of our brain. Trying to be rational / logical is trying to ignore the massive pattern-matching intelligence in our brains and depend on the really weak computation system that we developed as a training loop for that pattern matcher.

Mindshift: neither express nor supress (the two options we are used to). Both are violent to others & neither uses the intelligence of the emotion. Instead, *acknowledge*, *attain safety*, *inquire within*, and then *act in alignment*.

The biggest challenge is that states of high emotion tend to rob us of our ability to take perspective. And taking perspective is used in all 4 steps. So this requires a lot of practice at perspective-shifting. The handy-dandy guide is here to help you succeed even as you are still practicing.

Mindshift: emotions arise only on important items. The subconscious filters all the events, and then passes on only relevant stuff. It indicates something's relevance (degree and kind) by tagging it with an emotion. So the only things that really matter are those that bring up an emotion. Anything that everyone is addressing rationally is probably irrelevant and should be dropped, in order to make space for the emotionally-charged items.

Key emotions and their purposes:

## Mad (Anger)

### Acknowledge

**Arises when:** something that matters deeply to you is under threat.

Provides:

1. Energy to do something about it.
2. Clear indication of what is threatening (but often not what is being threatened).

### Attain safety

1. Can you see at least 3 perspectives on the situation? If not, do something to reduce flooding.
2. Are you able to pause whatever is happening in this situation enough to process? If not, then take note of this situation and fix the "unsafe to pause and improve" problem in your next retro.
3. Do you feel safe with the others present in bringing up material that really matters (vulnerable and important)? If not, then note this situation and fix your relationships at another time to build sufficient safety.

### Inquire Within

1. What do I deeply value here that is under threat?

### Act: Build a Trellis

1. What about this situation is causing that value to be weak enough that this situation can threaten it?
2. What can I do, right now, to strengthen that value in this situation, so that what is happening now wouldn't be powerful enough to threaten it.
3. Who can I invite to help me build that?
4. Invite them and build the trellis.
5. How do you feel now that you have built this trellis with others? Let that sink into you as the feeling you get when you act in integrity with your anger.

## Sad (Sadness)

### Acknowledge

**Arises when:** something is no longer working for you and needs to be let go to make space for new growth.

Provides:

1. Clear visibility of what you are longing to create / have / maintain.
2. Clear indication of what is and is not working.
3. Mental flexibility to let go of a habit, so you can learn something new.

### Attain safety

1. Can you see the loss without blaming someone? Take a perspective of seeing just the raw loss, without story? If not, do something to reduce flooding.
2. Are you able to pause whatever is happening in this situation enough to process? If not, then take note of this situation and fix the "unsafe to pause and let go" problem in your next retro.

### Inquire Within

1. What am I longing for? What am I habituated to which is no longer serving me (and I wish still was)?

### Act: Wash Away the Habit

1. What is my habit here?
2. What parts serve me and what parts don't?
3. What am I really longing for?
4. Take that longing, feel the sadness, and let the tears well up, let the water wash away the parts that are no longer giving what I long for.
5. Thank the sadness and look to see if you now feel curious about new options. Let that sink into you as the feeling you get when you act in integrity with your sadness.

## Glad (Joy)

### Acknowledge

**Arises when:** you have had an unexpected success.

Note: successes that you expected tend to give contentment, not joy. Joy tends to arise when either you overcame a hard challenge (with a real risk of failing) or got lucky.

Provides:

1. Desire to connect with other people and share in the bounty.
2. Energy to create---making this success more systematic.
3. Clear indication of obstacles: how you got lucky or what you overcame.

### Attain safety

1. Can you acknowledge the factors of success that were not due to you? Can you honestly see how much the situation, the system, other people, and raw luck contributed to this outcome? If not, do something to reduce flooding.
2. Are you able to pause whatever is happening in this situation enough to process? If not, then take note of this situation and fix the "unsafe to pause and systematize" problem in your next retro.
3. Do you feel safe with the others present in both celebrating and bringing up the obstacles? Do you trust that they will both recognize the parts of your success that were due to you and the parts that were not, at the same time? Do you believe they will actively see this as an opportunity to make the system better while still celebrating you? If not, fix your relationships.

### Inquire Within

1. What needs to be celebrated, and what made this success unlikely?

### Act: Safeguard

1. Identify what people did to overcome obstacles. Also what the system did, and what you just got lucky on.
2. Celebrate the efforts of the people and the effectiveness of the system.
3. Identify hazards, starting from these 3 prompts:
  1. What made it so that a person had to put in effort and overcome an obstacle?
	2. How did the system account for obstacles and make it easier or harder to address them? (note: this will come up with contributing factors for your outcome, both hazards and safeguards)
	3. What were some near misses (places you almost had a problem, but got lucky)?
4. Get to key hazards & safeguards, schedule them into the near future.
5. Implement the safeguards.
6. Demonstrate both your success and the completed safeguards to someone outside the success who will celebrate with you.
7. How do you feel now about this situation? Let that sink into you as the feeling you get when you act in integrity with your joy.

## Afraid (Fear)

### Acknowledge

**Arises when:** Something survival-critical is about to happen / just happened.

Note: Fear is a complex, multi-stage emotion. It tends to have 3 phases:

1. Pre-event. Spidey-senses tingle. You become much more present and aware, sensing what is happening.
2. During-event. Shuts down pre-frontal cortex. Gives single, clear action to take in order to maximize chance of survival (at any cost).
3. Post-event. Turns on learning centers & replays event. This is the feeling most people associate with the word fear. It exists to help you learn so that you can avoid survival-threatening situations in the future.

Provides:

Before

1. Improved situational awareness.
2. Clear direction, sorting what impacts survival from everything else.

During

1. Single clear action to take.
2. Infinite energy to take that action.
3. Willingness to pay or externalize any cost---including others' survival.

After

1. Replay of events, with option to imagine what could be different.
2. Enhanced brain support for learning (blood supply, key neurotransmitters).
3. Strong desire to ensure that *never* happens again. To anyone, but especially to self.

### Attain safety

Before and during:

1. Follow your fear. Its whole intention is to establish safety. Don't second-guess it.

After:

1. Even while the events are replaying in your mind, are you able to see that you are now safe? If not, do whatever is necessary to help you see the wider perspective: you survived, and now you have a chance to change things for next time.
2. Are you able to pause whatever is happening in this situation enough to process? If not, then take note of this situation and fix the "unsafe to pause and learn" problem in your next retro.
3. Are you able to separate the threats from the people? Can you take perspective and see what drove a situation to be a survival threat, as separate from the people who may have been in the persecutor role? If not, take care of yourself to reduce emotional flooding until you can see perspective.
4. Do you feel safe with the others present in bringing up fears and survival threats? Are you confident that they'll acknowledge the threat that just happened (not tell you to "be brave" or otherwise dismiss)? Are you confident that they'll explore alternative possibilities with you, so you can all learn? If not, fix your relationships.

### Inquire Within

Before:

1. What's going on?

During:

1. What action do I need to take next?

After:

1. What actions did I take, and how did they turn out for me and others? What other possibilities might there have been / could there be next time?

### Act: Safeguard

1. You survived! Celebrate! Recognize the actions that you took and how those helped you survive the danger. Celebrate them, no matter what other costs they caused later---they helped you survive.
2. Identify what threats existed.
3. Identify what symptoms indicated those threats in advance.
4. Identify hazards, starting from these 3 prompts:
  1. What set up the situation to go in a bad way, putting people at risk or causing them to put others at risk?
	2. What information was missing during the situation that resulted in inneffective / sub-optimal responses?
	3. What actions did people take that made the situation worse or had significant external costs? What made those actions seem like the only possible action at the time?
5. Get to key hazards & safeguards, schedule them into the near future.
6. Implement the safeguards.
7. Demonstrate both your survival and the completed safeguards to someone outside the situation who will celebrate with you.
8. How do you feel now about the way you navigated this situation and your preparedness for next time something like this could arise? Let that sink into you as the feeling you get when you act in integrity with your fear.

## Ashamed (Shame)

### Acknowledge

**Arises when:** you are just took some action (or non-action) that will damage your relationship with someone.

Provides:

1. Brakes! Gets you to pull back and stop taking actions, so you don't make it worse.
2. Desire to apologize and restore.
3. Clear indication of what matters to your connection.
4. Clear indication of your transgression and the harm it inflicted.

### Attain safety

1. Are you able to acknowledge that you made a mistake without beating yourself up for being a bad person? Can you take the perspective to see that you can do harm without being inherently flawed? Can you also see that you did harm without trying to defend or explain why, just that you did harm? If not, take note of the situation and go work on your relationship with your own inner critic.
	Once you've gotten your own responses clean, then choose whether to bring the situation back to the other person and take the restorative actions below.
	For the first many times of your practice, you may well not be able to go beyond this step. That's OK; just increasing your own safety in the presence of having done harm will tend to decrease the harm you inflict.
2. Are you able to pause whatever is happening in this situation enough to process? If not, then take note of this situation and fix the "unsafe to pause and heal" problem in your next retro.
3. Do you feel safe with the others present in bringing up the harm you inflicted and apologizing? Are you confident that they will be open to your vulnerability, rather than attacking you, even though you just hurt them or your relationship with them? If not, fix your relationships.

### Inquire Within

1. What harm did I just do, and what action inflicted that harm? What do I value in this relationship that I just transgressed?

### Act: Restore Relationships

1. Stop! Don't keep digging. Also don't attack self. Simply see that harm was done.
2. Ask yourself what action you took and what harm it did.
3. Ask why that particular harm seems so important to you. What do you value in this relationship that was just harmed?
4. Apologize. Be specific. State the behavior that you did, the harm you perceive, that you're sorry, and what you value in the relationship.
5. Ask yourself and the other whether there is anything you could do that would enhance the value you have at stake here, so it would be strong enough that your action would not have harmed it.
6. Take some of those actions in order to strengthen the value. Take actions together with the person you harmed, not for them.
7. How does it feel to acknowledge a mistake without defensiveness,  apologize, have that accepted, and then acting to strengthen what you value in the relationship? Let that sink into you as the feeling you get when you act in integrity with your shame.
